# 💳 Cashier Ordering System

## Overview
The cashier ordering system allows vendors to take orders manually for customers who prefer to pay at the counter instead of using the QR code system. Both QR code orders and cashier orders appear in the same unified order queue.

## How It Works

### For Vendors:
1. **Access Cashier Tab**: Go to vendor dashboard → Cashier tab
2. **Take Customer Info**: Enter customer phone number (required) and name (optional)
3. **Build Order**: Select items from the menu, adjust quantities as needed
4. **Add Instructions**: Include any special requests from the customer
5. **Create Order**: Click "Create Cash Order" - payment is marked as paid (cash collected)
6. **Order Processing**: Order appears in the Orders tab alongside QR code orders

### For Customers:
- Customers who don't want to scan QR codes can order directly through the cashier
- Payment is collected in cash at the counter
- They receive the same order number and pickup process as QR code customers
